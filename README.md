Data from published updates by the Spanish Ministry of Health, detailing the number of diagnosed cases, ICU admissions and deaths, by Autonmous Region (Comunidad Autónoma).

**Up-to-date as of**: 27/03/2020 at 19h

**UPDATE!!!**: I've been told that the Ministry of Health has recently started publishing the data feed via Instituto de Salud Carlos III: you can find the data here: [https://covid19.isciii.es/resources/serie_historica_acumulados.csv](https://covid19.isciii.es/resources/serie_historica_acumulados.csv)


## Read first

* The data has been extracted from the "daily" updates published by the Spanish Ministry of Health [in this webpage](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/situacionActual.htm)
* The data is published in an [unhelpful PDF format](https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_46_COVID-19.pdf), so I used the open-source PDF-extraction tool [Tabula](https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula) to extract the tabular data into CSV formatted files.
* **Warning I**: The format of the published data has varied several times, so in some cases I had to manually update the extracted CSVs to achieve some level of consistency in their format. I have not altered the values in any way (unless they were altered by accident during the extraction process)
* **Warning II**: The Health Ministry did not publish data for March 7th and 8th. Also, for March 14th and 15th they did not publish the ICU admission counts.

## Dataset
